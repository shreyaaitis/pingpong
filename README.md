The **Ping Pong Game** is a two-player arcade-style game developed using Pythonâ€™s **Turtle** module for graphics and the **OS** module for sound effects. It simulates a classic table tennis match, where two paddles move vertically to hit a bouncing ball and prevent it from passing their side of the screen. The game features a simple yet engaging scoring system, where players earn points when their opponent fails to return the ball. Player 1 controls the left paddle using the `W` and `S` keys, while Player 2 controls the right paddle using the up and down arrow keys. The ball moves automatically, bouncing off the paddles and screen edges, creating a dynamic and fast-paced challenge. The inclusion of sound effects enhances the gameplay experience, making each hit and score more immersive. Designed with simplicity and interactivity in mind, this project serves as both an entertaining game and a great learning experience for those interested in Python-based game development.
